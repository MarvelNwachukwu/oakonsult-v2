      <h2>About OAKONSULT</h2>
      <p>
        OAKONSULT DISABILITIES OUTREACH (OAKONSULT) is a mission focused on
        introducing people with special needs children (parents/carers) to the
        possibility of having a purposeful and fulfilled lifestyle despite life
        demands associated with the caring role. We also work with churches and
        other organizations to create awareness and build inclusive culture in
        relation to people with disabilities and their families.
      </p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        OAKONSULTâ€™s mandate is to introduce the gospel of Christ to Carers. We

        biblical principles and truths that will enable them find fulfilment at
        whatever stage they might be in their individual journeys.
